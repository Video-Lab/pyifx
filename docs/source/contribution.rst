Suggested Prerequisites
-----------------------

You can contribute in may ways besides helping write the underlying code; testers and technical writers are also very important to this project. Please read the list of suggested prerequisites before starting.

Library Contribution
********************

This library is written in Python, so some fundamental understanding of Python can help you navigate the library. Additional libraries (both internal and external) used in the library include:

	* NumPy
	* Imageio
	* OS
	* Math

Understanding these libraries as a whole is not needed. However, understanding their purpose and what some of their main modules do can help when faced with code that uses them.

Documentation Contribution
**************************

Our doucmentation is written in Sphinx, a Python-based documentation tool. You can learn more about Sphinx by visiting their `user guide <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html>`_.

For those looking to work on the structure of the documentation, some understanding of Sphinx and RST (reStructuredText) can be helpful. However, if you are more focused on the content of the documentation, then these tools will not be of much use. No matter what you are focusing on, some understanding of these tools is still highly recommended.
